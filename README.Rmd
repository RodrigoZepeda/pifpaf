> The `pifpaf` package corresponds to an **update** on the previous [homonimous package](https://github.com/INSP-RH/pifpaf) developed at INSP. 

# Installation

You can install the development version of `pifpaf` from [GitHub](https://github.com/pifpaf) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("RodrigoZepeda/pifpaf", dependencies = TRUE)
```

# Usage

The main purpose of the package is to calculate **potential impact fractions** and **population attributable fractions** for a specific case: when the exposure information comes from cross-sectional studies (in particular, surveys) and the relative risk information from the literature (_e.g._ metanalysis). 

In our package we assume the user has access to the data either as **individual-level** exposure (_e.g._ the user has access to the survey) or the user has access to **aggregated data** on the exposure (_e.g._ the user has the population-mean exposure and its confidence interval). The following table shows which function to use depending on the case:

| **Exposure data** | Population Attributable Fraction | Potential Impact Fraction |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| [Individual-level](#individual-level-data)  | [`paf`](#population-attributable-fraction)| [`pif`](#potential-impact-fraction) |
| [Aggregated](#aggregated-data) | [`paf_approximate`](#approximate-population-attributable-fraction)| [`pif_approximate`](#approximate-potential-impact-fraction) |

> **Note** If the user has available both **individual-level** and **aggregated data** they should prefer the **individual-level** information as it captures better the sample's variability. The population attributable fraction and potential impact fractions estimated from **aggregated data** are only approximations and are biased estimates. 

## Individual-level data 

In the case of individual-level data the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) and the
Potential Impact Fraction (PIF) can be estimated directly via the `pif()` and `paf()` functions. 
For the purpose of this example, we will use data from the Mexican 
National Health and Nutrition Survey of 2018 (ENSANUT 2018):

```{r}
data(ensanut)

head(ensanut)
```

The data contains information on the age, sex, weight (grams), hypertension status, systolic blood pressure and change in sodium from a policy intervention.
